      "\n",
      "Your agricultural sustainability score of **31.48 out of 100** indicates significant room for improvement in your farming practices to minimize environmental impact. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What this score means for you:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Below Average:** This score suggests your current practices are likely having a moderate negative impact on the environment.\n",
      "* **Economic Risks:**  Unsustainable practices expose you to future risks like soil degradation impacting yield, water scarcity increasing irrigation costs, and stricter environmental regulations limiting your options.\n",
      "* **Consumer Pressure:** Increasingly, consumers are demanding sustainably produced food.  A low score could put you at a disadvantage in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analyzing the Factors:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's analyze the provided factors to understand the score:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Positives:** \n",
      "    * **Soil pH (6.5):**  Good - Suitable for wheat and nutrient availability.\n",
      "    * **Temperature (25¬∞C):** Optimal for wheat growth.\n",
      "* **Areas for Improvement:**\n",
      "    * **Soil Moisture (30%):** This seems low. Assuming this is a one-time reading, it might not reflect the whole season. Consistent monitoring is essential, especially during critical growth stages. Aim for optimal moisture levels (likely around 40-50% depending on soil type) to reduce irrigation needs.\n",
      "    * **Rainfall (100mm):**  This value likely represents a period, not an annual amount. More context is needed, but if rainfall is insufficient, water management through efficient irrigation techniques (drip irrigation) is crucial.\n",
      "    * **Fertilizer Usage (60kg):**  This appears high.  High fertilizer use can lead to nutrient runoff, polluting water sources and impacting soil health long term. Implementing soil testing to guide precise fertilizer applications can significantly reduce your usage.\n",
      "    * **Pesticide Usage (5kg):**  While not extremely high, minimizing pesticide use is crucial.  Explore Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques like introducing beneficial insects, crop rotation, and resistant varieties to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides.\n",
      "    * **Crop Yield (2.5 tons):** For wheat, this yield is on the lower end.  Improving soil health, optimizing water and nutrient management, and employing IPM can lead to healthier plants and higher yields, maximizing resource use. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Water Management:** Implement water conservation practices:\n",
      "    * **Drip irrigation:** Delivers water directly to roots, minimizing water waste.  Initial investment can lead to long-term savings and environmental benefits.\n",
      "    * **Mulching:** Retains soil moisture, reducing irrigation needs and controlling weeds.\n",
      "2. **Nutrient Management:**\n",
      "    * **Soil testing:**  Regular testing helps determine precise fertilizer needs, minimizing overuse and saving money.\n",
      "    * **Cover cropping:** Planting cover crops in the off-season improves soil structure, nitrogen fixation, and reduces erosion.\n",
      "3. **Pest Management:** \n",
      "    * **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combining beneficial insects, resistant crops, and careful monitoring can significantly reduce pesticide use.\n",
      "4. **Data-Driven Decisions:**  \n",
      "    * **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor soil moisture, plant health, and weather patterns to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.\n",
      "5. **Renewable Energy:** Explore options for incorporating renewable energy sources like solar panels to power irrigation systems or farm operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Environmental Impact of Improvements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these recommendations, you can expect:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved Soil Health:**  Reduced erosion, increased organic matter, and better water retention capacity.\n",
      "* **Water Conservation:** Less water wasted, reducing pressure on local water resources.\n",
      "* **Reduced Pollution:**  Minimize fertilizer and pesticide runoff, protecting water quality and ecosystems.\n",
      "* **Increased Biodiversity:**  Sustainable practices promote beneficial insect populations and wildlife habitat.\n",
      "* **Carbon Sequestration:** Healthy soils act as carbon sinks, mitigating climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
